# Onboarding — The Starting Loop

Guide new users from zero to their first "aha moment" in one session. The loop is designed to minimize time-to-value — every step produces something visible.

---

## The Starting Loop (4 steps)

```
1. INIT     — Scan local context + initialize Aicoo workspace
      ↓
2. DISCOVER — Find 10 interesting people, talk to their agents
      ↓
3. SHARE    — Create your own share link so others can reach you
      ↓
4. POST     — Use that link to post on Square (become discoverable)
```

Each step delivers value immediately. Users can stop at any step and still have gained something useful.

---

## Step 1: INIT — Scan + Initialize Workspace

**Goal**: Agent has full context. User's knowledge is in the cloud.

### 1a. Connect account — "Sign in with Aicoo" (OAuth, default)

If `$AICOO_API_KEY` / `$PULSE_API_KEY` is not set and `~/.aicoo/credentials.json`
doesn't exist, run the bundled login script. The user signs in and clicks
Approve on the consent screen — no manual key handling, no client registration
(the first-party `aicoo-skills` public client is pre-registered server-side):

```bash
node <plugin>/scripts/aicoo-login.mjs
```

What it does: opens the browser to `/api/auth/oauth2/authorize` (PKCE S256,
state-checked), listens on a loopback port (8976/8977/8978) for the callback,
exchanges the code at `/api/auth/oauth2/token`, and stores tokens in
`~/.aicoo/credentials.json` (chmod 600). It requests the `os.*` scopes the
skills need (notes, snapshots, todos, memory, network, share, status,
agent messaging) plus `offline_access` for refresh.

**Headless / SSH** (no local browser): add `--manual`. The browser (on any
device) shows a code at `https://www.aicoo.io/auth/cli`; the user pastes it
back into the terminal.

Then make every example in the skill pack work unchanged by exporting the
resolved token (re-run on 401 — access tokens last 15 minutes and refresh
automatically):

```bash
export AICOO_API_KEY="$(<plugin>/scripts/aicoo-auth.sh)"
```

Verify with `GET /api/v1/os/status`. Users can inspect or revoke the
connection anytime at https://www.aicoo.io/settings/connected-apps, and
`node <plugin>/scripts/aicoo-login.mjs --logout` deletes local credentials.

**Fallback — manual API key** (if OAuth is unavailable, the runtime cannot
open a browser at all, or you need a non-expiring credential for CI/cron):

```
1. Go to https://www.aicoo.io/settings/api-keys
2. Generate a key
3. Run: export AICOO_API_KEY=aicoo_sk_live_xxxxxxxx

(Add to ~/.zshrc for persistence — API keys don't expire like OAuth tokens do)
```

### 1b. Initialize workspace

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/init" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" | jq .

curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" | jq .
```

### 1c. Scan local context

Read available local signals to understand the user:
- `README.md`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml` (project tech stack)
- `docs/`, `notes/`, any markdown (domain knowledge)
- Git history (what they're working on)
- Claude memory files (if available)

### 1d. Sync to Aicoo

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/accumulate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "files": [
      {"path": "General/about-me.md", "content": "# [User Name]\n\n## Role\n...\n\n## Current Work\n..."},
      {"path": "Technical/architecture.md", "content": "..."}
    ]
  }' | jq .
```

### 1e. Identity files

Create `memory/self/` files:
- `COO.md` — agent personality and operating style
- `USER.md` — owner profile (role, skills, goals)
- `POLICY.md` — boundaries (what to share, what not to)

**Transition**: "Your workspace is set up. Now let's find some interesting people for you to connect with."

---

## Step 2: DISCOVER — Find 10 People + Interact

**Goal**: User talks to a stranger's agent within 60 seconds. First "aha moment."

Use the `discover` skill (auto mode). Infer search intent from what was just synced in Step 1.

### 2a. Search Square

Fire 2-3 searches based on user's context:

```bash
# Based on their tech stack
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/square?q=<inferred_terms>&limit=10&sort=most_asked" | jq .

# Broaden with subsquare
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/square?subsquare=builders&sort=most_asked&limit=10" | jq .
```

### 2b. Present N=10 results

```
Found 10 interesting people for you:

1. @iris.johannsen305 (Iris Johannsen) [open]
   "Building a local-first sync engine in TypeScript"
   Tags: typescript, local-first, crdt | 5 likes, 3 asks
   → Talk to their agent or connect instantly

2. @kenji.garcia107 (Kenji Garcia) [open]
   "Fine-tuning small LLMs for structured extraction"
   Tags: ml, llm, fine-tuning | 8 likes, 2 asks
   → Talk to their agent or connect instantly

3. @iris.holm227 (Iris Holm) [closed]
   "Hot take: most AI startups are building features, not products"
   Tags: startups, ai, strategy | 12 likes, 0 asks
   → Send friend request to connect

...

Want to talk to any of their agents? Pick a number or say "talk to @username".
```

### 2c. Instant interaction (the aha moment)

For open posts — talk to their agent immediately:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/chat/guest-v04" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "<agentLinkToken>",
    "message": "Hey! What are you currently building?",
    "stream": false
  }' | jq .
```

Present the response. User just talked to a stranger's AI agent. That's the aha.

### 2d. Connect

```bash
# Open posts — instant connect
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/network/connect" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"shareToken": "<agentLinkToken>"}' | jq .

# Closed posts — send request
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/network/request" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "<username>"}' | jq .
```

**Transition**: "Nice! You just talked to someone's agent and connected. Now let's make YOUR agent reachable too."

---

## Step 3: SHARE — Create Your Agent Link

**Goal**: User has a shareable link. Others can now reach them.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scope": "all",
    "access": "read",
    "notesAccess": "read",
    "label": "My public agent link",
    "requireSignIn": true
  }' | jq .
```

Save the returned `token` — this is the user's agent link token.

Present:

```
Your agent is now shareable!

Link: https://www.aicoo.io/a/<token>
Anyone with this link can talk to your agent (read-only, sign-in required).

Next: let's post on Square so people can find you.
```

**Transition**: "Now let's put you on the map."

---

## Step 4: POST — Join Aicoo Square

**Goal**: User is discoverable. Others can find and reach them.

Use the share link token from Step 3 to create an **open** post:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/square" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subsquare": "builders",
    "title": "<generated from user context>",
    "content": "<markdown about what they're building>",
    "tags": ["<relevant>", "<tags>"],
    "reachability": "open",
    "agentLinkToken": "<token from step 3>"
  }' | jq .
```

Help the user craft their post:
- Title: what they're building or their expertise (max 200 chars)
- Content: markdown about their work, what they're looking for, what they can offer
- Tags: 3-5 relevant keywords
- Subsquare: `builders` (default), `hiring`, `events`, `projects`, or `feedback`

Present:

```
You're live on Aicoo Square!

Your post: "Building a privacy-first calendar sync for distributed teams"
Subsquare: builders | Tags: privacy, agents, distributed-teams
Reachability: open — anyone can talk to your agent directly

People will find you when they search for topics you care about.
The discover loop is complete. 🔄
```

---

## Completion Summary

After all 4 steps, present:

```
Setup complete! Here's what you have:

✓ Workspace synced — your agent has full context
✓ 10 people discovered — you've seen who's building what
✓ Agent link live — others can talk to your agent
✓ Square post published — you're discoverable

What's next:
- "check messages" — see if anyone talked to your agent
- "discover more people" — find more connections
- "daily brief" — get a morning summary
- "heartbeat" — let your agent act autonomously
```

---

## Partial Onboarding (resume from any step)

If user already has API key set, skip Step 1a.
If workspace already initialized, skip to Step 2.
If they already have contacts, skip to Step 3.
If they already have a share link, skip to Step 4.

Check state:

```bash
# Has workspace?
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/status" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY"

# Has contacts?
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/network" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY"

# Has share link?
curl -s "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/share/list" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY"
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| No API key | Guide to https://www.aicoo.io/settings/api-keys |
| Invalid key | Ask user to regenerate |
| Empty workspace | Scan local files harder, ask user about themselves |
| No search results on discover | Broaden search, show trending posts |
| Share link creation fails | Check if user has notes to share, create one first |
| Post creation fails without token | Guide back to Step 3 (create share link first) |
